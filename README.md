# outbreak_tracking
This is my repository for the Manning LiveProject "Discovering Disease Outbreaks from News Headlines"

This LiveProject tracks disease outbreaks from (fictional) newspaper headlines. The skills it builds are 

1. Text Extraction with regular expressions with the re: library
2. Manipulation of data with the pandas: library
3. Geographic clustering with k-means or DBSCAN in the scikit-learn: library
4. Data visualization with the basemap: library
5. Model tuning
6. Data visualization with the matplotlib: library
7. Interpreting results in context
8. Summarizing findings with the nbconvert: library.
